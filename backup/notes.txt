on UNIX/Linux system "mysqldumper.bat" will not work. you must use cron and set mysqldump command from "mysqldumper.bat" as schedule
on Windows system you must use Task Scheduler and set new task as run program with the time start task

"db_backup.xml" file is export task from Task Scheduler in Windows system

location of mysqldump is dependent from operating system and database server (for example: XAMPP, MS MySQL Server, Oracle). you must change path to mysqldump from script "mysqldumper.bat"
